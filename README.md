# VisualizationOfGraphAlgoUsingJavaFx

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

The Mainframe work is done using javafx , we have tried to  implement most of the components available in javafx such as labels,multiple scenes, customised buttons, tools from jfoneix, controlsfx libraries and designed the scenes using scene builder and css.

We have implemented the following concepts in java like Inheritance-we have extended circle class in Node fx class to give the shape of circle for a node.

Polymorphism-we have overridden inbuilt node class as per our requirements.

Abstraction/Encapsulation- we have created edge class and right click menu class and we have used it multiple times showing only necessary data.

Interface-Some of the interfaces we have used here are initializable,changeListener,ComparableNode.

Package-We have used many packages ,to name a few java package-util,io,net and in javafx-scene,fxml,event etc.

Threads-We have used a thread in panel1 Controller for selecting properties of graph.

Collection Framework-We have used this to implement algorithms.example-Linked list,arraylist.

Lambda expression-We have used this for button events.

Exceptional handling-We have used io exceptional handling for switching between multiple scenes.
